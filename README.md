# One-Dimensional Array Game
This is an activity to practice One-Dimensional programming. It consists of the game of the goose.

This game is a board game for two or more players. Each player rolls a die and advances his piece (according to the number obtained) through a snail-shaped board with 63 squares, with drawings. Depending on the square in which it falls, you can advance or on the contrary go back, and in some of them a punishment or a prize is indicated.

On his turn, each player rolls 2 dice that indicate the number of squares he must advance. The first player to reach box 63, "the garden of the goose", wins the game.
